#Question 1
# Define the Superhero class
class Superhero:
    # Constructor to initialize the attributes of the superhero
    def __init__(self, name, power, city):
        self.name = name   # Name of the superhero
        self.power = power # Superpower of the superhero
        self.city = city   # City where the superhero operates

    # Method to simulate using the superhero's power
    def use_power(self):
        return f"{self.name} uses {self.power} to save the day in {self.city}!"

# Define the Sidekick class that inherits from Superhero
class Sidekick(Superhero):
    # Constructor to initialize the attributes of the sidekick
    def __init__(self, name, power, city, sidekick_name):
        super().__init__(name, power, city) # Initialize the parent class attributes
        self.sidekick_name = sidekick_name   # Name of the sidekick

    # Method for the sidekick to assist the superhero
    def assist(self):
        return f"{self.sidekick_name} assists {self.name} with their powers!"

#usage
hero = Superhero("Captain Swift", "super speed", "Metropolis") # Create a Superhero object
sidekick = Sidekick("Captain Swift", "super speed", "Metropolis", "Speedy") # Create a Sidekick object

# Print the result of using the superhero's power
print(hero.use_power())
# Print the result of the sidekick assisting the superhero
print(sidekick.assist())
